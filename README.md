# Master Thesis

This directory contains the code for my master thesis in PAH3901 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The thesis' working title is "Effects of longitudinal leisure-time physical activity and changes of it in relation to risk of all-cause mortality: a HUNT study.

## Github Repository Structure

There are primarily two sub-folders of interest in this repo for reproductional purposes: **code** and **renv**. The code folder contains all the code that's been used in the thesis, and the renv folder contains information on the packages I've used and their versions. For more information about code, see the **README** in the code folder.

## Data Availability

The HUNT data used for the analyses is unfortunately not available through this GitHub, but see **https://www.ntnu.edu/hunt** for more information about data availability.
