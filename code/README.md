# Code

All scripts for the analyses has an intuitive file name. For example, the script that contains Cox regressions without considering change in LTPA for all HUNT surveys is called **multiadjusted_and_crude_hr_all_surveys_no_change_in_pa.R**.

All the analysis scripts use functions I've created for the analyses which are located in the **functions.R** script. Each script calls this script before it can run. As of now, there are no other documentation than what it says inside the script, but it is rather intuitive what the code does.
