# Code

There are primarily four scripts of interest for the analyses:

1. data_preparation.qmd. This script loads the data, does some general data processing and distinguishes the data into separate data frames.

2. functions.qmd. This script contains functions used in the analyses. Each function **should** (I hope) have an intuitive name and should be fairly straightforward to use.

3. no_change_in_pa.qmd. This script contains all the analyses and results related to leisure-time physical activity as a single point in time. There are also other scripts where there are suffixes explaining the stratification or sensitivity analysis applied. For example, no_change_in_pa_socio_strat.qmd is the exact same analysis but stratified by socioeconomic status.

4. change_in_pa.qmd. This script contains all the analyses and results related to leisure-time physical activity as multiple points in time (i.e., change). The same apply here as with the suffixes in no_change_in_pa.qmd.

To understand what has been done, use the analyses scripts (3 and 4) together with functions.qmd.
